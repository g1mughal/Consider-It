Postdoctoral researchers  from all disciplines will be eligible (e.g. epidemiology, engineering of materials, diagnostic tools, psychology, economics, social history, education, sociology, political science, medical and health humanities and philosophy), as long as their research projects fall within the remit of public-health crises.DOROTHY's goals are:-Support fellows’ career development, through excellent training and supervision and mentoring, and prepare them for future career opportunities by means of the exceptional  skills and timely and topical experience that will be gained through these fellowships. - Create  a critical mass of well-networked experts, from all disciplinary areas, who will be  fully able to engage with the Irish and EU innovation ecosystem, through the set-up of an innovative multidisciplinary research and training platform. These individuals will be trained to tackle future public-health crises in ways that will lead to positive societal impact.-Promote the dissemination and communication of impactful research beyond traditional academic channels, targeting policymakers and population at large , with the objective of contributing to resourceful and resilient societies. - Pioneer an innovative multidisciplinary approach to the way public health crises are understood and tackled.  As they are broad-ranging and complex phenomena, with multi-issue implications, solutions cannot prescind from the cooperation between disciplines, sectors and research areas. DOROTHY, which shows the feasibility of that, aims to become a replicable template for multidisciplinary, international and intersectoral training approaches.;02.09.21 20:45;235801

CNMT plans in a joint venture with the Dutch SME BLUE-Tec (also partner in ITS-THIN) to introduce these membranes into the water filtration market. Recently, scientists at Friedrich-Schiller University Jena (FSU) showed in the framework of the Graphene FET-flagship a high proton and lithium ion permeance of CNMs. Combining these findings with the ability to produce large-area CNM-composite membranes, a fully new technology is emerging: the use of ultrathin CNMs as separator membranes or proton exchange membranes (PEM) in battery and fuel cell applications. Thinner membranes promise a faster and more selective ion transport resulting in smaller, more powerful, and more reliable energy storage devices. This new window of opportunity will be explored in this feasibility study. In case of a positive outcome, CNergy will result in a business and action plan, how to introduce CNMs into batteries and fuel cells.;21.05.21 11:29;235780

These features, in contrast to standard solar panels or tiles, entail high ease of installment (40% lower installation time), reliability (i.e. 30% higher lifetime and lower maintenance costs) and safety (<120V operations vs. 400V), as well as increased exploitation of available roof area (30% more). With E-Tile+, 20-30 million roofs across the EU, which cannot be served with standard solar panels today, could be targeted to harvest solar energy. Furthermore, our unique and patented tiles contacting approach (plug-and-play and parallel connection) provides more power output (20% higher conversion efficiency) than today’s solar panels. The latter are connected in-series and thus suffer from shadow effects, high additional costs and danger (high-voltage operations that require specially qualified electricians). Hence, E-Tile+ is a solar system specifically designed for the needs of construction companies, complying with upcoming energy regulations and solving the current issues of traditional PV roof panels.This FTI project will mature E-Tile+ in terms of performance, manufacturing cost, production yield and ensure full qualification of our product for its launch in our target markets, with a Business Plan adapted to guarantee a fast and sustained market entry. TilePlus project will address the solar roof market. We will argue that E-Tile+ can be installed on 13,700 roofs, while providing 142GWh in year 5 post-project, generating accumulated revenues of €267m and net profits of €156m, create 65 new FTEs among the consortium and unlocking CO2 emission cuts of 64.4kt.;21.05.21 14:25;236314

IC`s disruptive innovation is a micro-structured reactor technology, which can be integrated into containers, allowing a numbering-up that makes the exploration of local and world-scale renewable feedstock sources economically feasible. The Fischer-Tropsch reactor is simultaneously producing e-Diesel and e-kerosene – two renewable products, which, after separation and final conditioning, can help customers in road transport and aviation to significantly reduce their CO2 footprint.  IC has implemented 10 demonstration plants so far, reaching TRL 7. With IMPOWER2X TRL 9 is reachable.To become even more successful, IC must transform its technology from demonstration applications to industrial application, consequently reducing the costs to provide the technology. To achieve that, existing plant concepts will be modularized and standardized, a serial production of the modules as well as the reactors built up and plants implemented at industrial scale and at customers’ sites. Additionally, the public and political acceptance for renewable fuels must be sharpened.IC will be able to either sell its plants or to provide long-term off-take agreements to customers in the field of e Diesel and e-kerosene, finally allowing to reduce the CO2 footprint of the individual customers by nearly 100%. Geographical sweet spots as well as promising customers worldwide will mainly be targeted.IMPOWER2X is in alignment with IC’s strategy of strengthening its position as market leader for synthetic, renewable fuel. With IC’s solution, customers and countries will be able to reach their climate targets and positively contribute to the environmental targets. This way the proposal serves the goals of the Green Deal by supporting the EU´s climate mitigation ambitions by helping to come to a clean and sustainable mobility and industry.;21.05.21 14:24;236312

The aim of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms controlling the removal of differentiated cells from the villus. Preliminary data indicate that most extruding cells are non-apoptotic suggesting alternative mechanisms regulating this key homeostatic event. Cells might either commit to extrusion through specific differentiation programs or local tissue mechanical constraints might force the extrusion of otherwise indistinguishable cells. Feedback between cell fate and mechanical constraints can be also envisaged. Here I propose to identify genes that control cell extrusion by analyzing the dynamic transcriptomic signature of the mouse intestinal epithelium using nascent mRNA sequencing (scEU-seq) and pharmacologic inhibition of candidate pathways in intestinal organoids. Target genes will be functionally validated by a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout screen. This analysis will be flanked by experiments investigating a potential role of tissue-scale mechanical forces in cell extrusion. I will measure the mechanical properties of the intestinal epithelium and obtain a detailed description of the morphological dynamics characterizing cell extrusion using live imaging and 3D-shape reconstruction. Precise manipulation of cortical tension by means of laser ablation combined with subcellular optogenetics will be used to functionally perturb tissue mechanics and reveal the impact of cell contractility and tissue tension on the extrusion process. Collectively, this project will help understanding how tissue homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium is maintained and dissect the relative contribution of genetic signaling circuits and tissue mechanics in regulating cell extrusion.;03.05.21 21:40;235643

Gliomas constitute 60% of all brain tumours and 50% of these are considered aggressive malignant tumours. Among aggressive gliomas, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the deadliest and remains largely incurable. Our goal is to develop the first GBM drug for both adults and children, to improve its «universally miserable outcomes». We have discovered a novel family of compounds that are cytotoxic to cancer cells, especially to GBM. In our preclinical studies, our lead drug from these proprietary compounds (GLIX1) showed total elimination of GBM tumour mass in 50% of mice, and tumour regression in all mice.We now need to further develop GLIX1 in order to reach human clinical trials, and ultimately approval for clinical use. The critical aspects of this development includes: the establishment and optimization of a chemical synthesis method for GLIX1; synthesis of small batches and subsequent large-scale production for pre-clinical and clinical studies; and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) related regulatory affairs.Hemispherian does not have these skills in-house, albeit they are extremely critical for the success of any drug. In that regard, the SME Innovation Associate Programme fits perfectly into our plan of boosting R&D activities within chemical synthesis. Through the recruitment of an Innovation Associate and implementation of the chemGLIO project, we will develop our novel chemical synthesis method and utilise it in the development of our ground-breaking treatment for GBM.";05.03.21 15:26;231487

The goal of CervixCare is to scientifically and technologically characterize the gynaecological device in terms of measuring functions and gather clinical evidence to validate the diagnostic value of the medical device.The uniqueness of the system relies on its novel methodology to detect the risk of PTB, as there is no other commercially available solution based on the cervix stiffness. The proposed recruitment of an Innovation Associate in CervixCare will have significant impact on the business opportunities of Pregnolia by bringing in lacking expertise for the validation and certification of Pregnolia’s System into a diagnostic medical device.  The envisaged grant will help to overcome the recruitment barriers of being a relatively unknown, small start-up enterprise that cannot compete with larger companies due to limited visibility, salary, recruitment budget and (perceived) career opportunities.CervixCare requires a multi-disciplinary scientist that understands the biomechanics for soft tissue, is able to model/simulate data by performing experiments and is able to use data for complex requirements for clinical validation and regulation of the diagnostic medical device. The main added value of the CervixCare project for the IA is the opportunity to pursue the transition from an academic environment focusing on basic research to a business environment focusing on developing competitive and cutting-edge products. Next to this, the IA will have the opportunity to influence and participate in the early stages of a new and innovative diagnostic device company.;22.10.21 10:50;231551

Evolutionary studies of ‘environment’ often apply arbitrary categories (e.g. fossorial, arboreal) that vaguely blend biotic and abiotic factors, limiting quantitative studies of form-function links. Innovatively, this project will test the hypothesis that a continuous physical variable (substrate density) has driven head shape adaptation. Under this hypothesis, a density gradient mirrors a phenotypic response gradient. Snakes are a superb system to study head shape adaptations because of: 1) spectacular taxonomic and phenotypic diversity, including many independent origins of aquatic and burrowing forms, and 2) limblessness, requiring snake heads to adapt to demands for locomotion as well as feeding, and protecting sensory organs. Similarities in aquatic and burrowing snake heads have been explained by adaptation to mostly unspecified environmental factors. Testing the hypothesis that variation in head shape is explained by substrate density will provide a fresh perspective on debates about the possibly aquatic or burrowing origin of snakes. I will quantify: a) head shape of snakes living in substrates of various densities, b) mechanical forces undergone by heads and skulls during headfirst locomotion, c) integration among head, skull and braincase shape. These data will be analysed in a comparative phylogenetic framework. HeadStrong combines 3D imaging, mechanics experiments with a snake-like robot and computer simulations that will be performed in globally leading institutions with unrivalled resources in terms of a vast reptile collection, outstanding imaging facilities, and expert staff. HeadStrong’s originality and interdisciplinary nature will generate exceptional datasets and high-profile outputs and establish the applicant as an innovative leader in functional biology.;03.06.21 01:14;234605

Respinova Ltd. has developed a novel device, called Pulsehaler™, to treat COPD in a revolutionary way by re-opening the small airways which are known to collapse in COPD patients thereby making it increasingly difficult to breathe. No other COPD treatment in the market today can effectively open these airways. In a clinical trial, PulseHaler™ was shown to substantially improve exercise capacity (the strongest predictor of morbidity and mortality), breathing ability, and quality of life of COPD sufferers. If Pulsehaler™ can reduce costs by the same magnitude to which it has been demonstrated to improve patients’ exercise capacity, the current cost burden of COPD in Europe could be reduced by up to €21B annually.We intend to complete several actions in this project which will bring Pulsehaler™ to the commercial market, and allow Respinova to scale up into a world leader in treating respiratory diseases. A multicenter international clinical trial will be conducted to further build data on Pulsehaler efficacy and support marketing launch. We will obtain CE Mark regulatory approval, and proceed to launch the Pulsehaler™ in the market, scaling up sales, marketing, and production.  Respinova Ltd. is a SME based in Israel with 12 employees currently. We have a seasoned management team with decades of combined medical device, business and leadership experience.

Still, cell-based therapies present challenges related chiefly to cell retention, engraftment and survival. Minimally invasive cell delivery and improved retention by means of an encapsulation technology is a driver for generating more predictable clinical outcomes with lesser immune rejection in a variety of disease areas. Stemmatters has built a highly versatile platform technology to design novel molecules with attributes to safeguard cells and support cell function and retention. Based on a chemically defined template, our technology provides rapid generation of compound libraries supporting establishment of safe, less costly and more effective cell-based therapies. The performance and cost effectiveness of our development platform surpasses competing technologies. NOAHs-ARK (spelled as Noah´s ark) aims to disrupt the current market landscape by developing Stemmatters’ encapsulation platform to other therapeutic applications of large unmet demand. Recruitment and integration of an Innovation associate (IA) with specific expertise in cell-based therapy into Stemmatters is a significant milestone that will dramatically increase Stemmatters capabilities, strengthen existing collaborations, and expand business opportunities. The IA will provide Stemmatters with important technical expertise and a comprehensive understanding of market unmet needs and current competitive dynamics. The IA will lead development of our innovative platform to other therapeutic applications of large unmet need, by designing in vitro studies for specific disease indications in need of enabling cell encapsulation solutions.

As its name indicates, REITER 3 is the third phase of a project that originally started in 2016 and that has the overarching goal of contributing to the monitoring and assessment of research and innovation (R&I) policies in Europe and beyond. It does this by surveying countries on their R&I policies, linking the collected policy data with other information (including statistics and other databases), and providing open data services through a dedicated web portal, the STIP Compass (http://stip.oecd.org). REITER 3 will maintain and update this infrastructure, and will aim to extend its uses and user base through new topic-based analysis and web services. Specifically, in a first part, the project will renew and upgrade STIP Compass databases and re-design the website’s graphical user interfaces. Among other things, this will will involve administering the 2021 edition of the EC-OECD STIP Survey. The project will also raise data quality, ensure linked data is up-to-date, revise and deepen taxonomies, and make the data accessible in STIP Compass. In a second part, the project will expand the uses and user base of STIP Compass by collecting data on and analysing topics that are high-priority for policymakers and analysts (such as the Covid-19 crisis and the climate emergency), and surfacing this in dedicated topic portals. This topic focus will make STIP Compass more relevant, raise its profile and reputation, and further incentivise countries to provide high quality data. Overall, the project’s overarching goal is to enhance the evidence base for R&I policies, which should in turn contribute to better national and European R&I policy and programme design.;09.04.21 14:49;234795

Such brain computations take place at a time scale of milliseconds or less, and rely on neuronal information transfer over subcellular structures which are called axons. Neuronal precision and speed can be achieved by wrapping axons with multi-lamellar membrane sheets of myelin and is of critical importance for proper brain function. Until recently, myelination was thought to be exclusive to long-range excitatory neuronal projections. This view has been drastically revised, and it is now commonly accepted that myelination can be abundant around the axons of local inhibitory interneurons as well. Parvalbumin positive basket cells (PV+ BCs) are fast spiking interneurons which are prominent in the hippocampus where they contribute to the synchrony of action potentials of large populations of neurons. They function as clockworks that drive network oscillations such as sharp wave ripples, are critical for memory consolidation, and are highly abundant in hippocampal area CA2. Whether myelination of the CA2 PV+ BC axon plays a role in their temporally precise inhibitory function, and whether this supports temporally precise neuronal encoding and cognitive performance remains obscure. In this Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship, I will address this question by combining my expertise in subcellular patch-clamp methods with the expertise of the host on Ca2+ imaging, myelin physiology, and in vivo electrophysiology. The proposed multimethod and multidisciplinary study will be unique in showing how biophysical changes in small neuronal compartments will lead to alterations of neuronal networks and ultimately to behavioral alterations of the organism.

Generally, consumers prefer liquid honey. They do not buy crystallized honey jars in supermarkets. So, if honey crystallizes within the shops before being sold, the retailers has the right to return it to the honey packer, with all associated costs. To avoid these reimbursements, honey packers are forced to pasteurize honey destined to retail. During pasteurization, raw honey is heated at 75-80ºC for 1-3 minutes to melt the sugar crystals, which act as nuclei starting points for crystallization. Unfortunately, such elevated temperature during the treatment causes serious degradation in most nutritive and beneficial substances that have categorized honey as a healthy medicinal food throughout the centuries. The result is that the clear liquid honey we are consuming is little different from a mix of sugars syrup. SonicatSystems is a technology-based company that have developed LIQUAM, a patented technology based on High Power Ultrasound for the respectful honey processing. With LIQUAM is possible to reduce the initial content of sugar crystals up to pasteurization levels, whilst retaining all nutrients contained in raw honey. However, to commercialize it, we need to increase their effiency and reduce manufacturing costs. Our innovative approach is to design and manufacture optimized ultrasound transducers well suited for highly viscous products such as honey due to commercial transducers are only optimized for applications involving water or low viscosity products. To this end, we need to incorporate an expert in ultrasound and vibro-acoustics technology. Our innovation strategy goes beyond.

Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are regions of genomes that are highly conserved across distantly related organisms. Many UCEs are located in cis-regulatory (enhancer) regions of the genome that play critical developmental roles in determining morphology; when UCEs are removed notable changes to the skulls and limbs of mammals can occur. These UCEs are highly conserved across vertebrates and the evolutionary loss of a single UCE (Sonic hedgehog limb enhancer) has been associated with partial and complete limb loss in squamate reptiles. However, much of what is known about the causal role UCEs play in development is derived from functional studies, which have only examined a handful of model species. A broader phylogenetic and genomic perspective of how UCEs relate to morphological variation would offer much needed information for interpreting the results of functional studies. Comparative genomics offers a means to dramatically increase the taxonomic sampling of UCEs, both through examination of annotated genomes and comparison of UCE loci obtained using sub-genomic sampling methodologies. I will use UCEs to characterize the enhancer landscapes of squamate reptiles that putatively underpin cranial and limb diversity. I will then relate the dynamics of these genomic landscapes to the modularity and integration of crania and limbs that occur across squamates using 3-dimensional (3D) scan data derived from museum specimens.

This parasite is currently treated with chemicals, which are considered a necessary evil by a population of beekeepers that considers chemical treatments largely as a threat because themselves are a cause for the bees’ population decline. In view of these problems, other alternatives have been researched for decades, being the hyperthermia the methodology with highest potential to displace the use of chemicals. However, until now the current commercial solutions based on hyperthermia principles are not an alternative to chemical products due to a lower efficiency.Vatorex AG is an award winning Swiss company committed toproviding cost-efficient and eco-friendly solutions for beekeepers. The new business started in 2016 and provides beekeepers with an eco-friendly solution to protect their hives from their greatest enemy: the Varroa mite.We have developed an eco-friendly solution to kill the Varroa mites by using a natural principle of different heat tolerances of bees and varroa. In a range between 39°C - 42°C the parasite dies while the bees survive unharmed. In contrast to other hyperthermia systems, Vatorex Varroa Solution heats the brood combs directly from the inside thanks to a heating coil that acts like a floor-heating. Vatorex Varroa Solution has proven to be an effective treatment directly in the beehive (95% of male mites and nymphs die at 41ºC within 2 hours of treatment). The Vatorex-System means a reduction of sanitary cost of 66% per hive and a 18% in total cost of honey production that entails a total saving impact for the approximately 600,000 European beekeepers and their 17 million of hives. Vatorex is fully aligned with the European policy initiatives in biodiversity and pollinator protection such as European long-term survival strategy or the objectives of the EU Habitat directive.;09.04.21 14:38;231310

Although less visible to the eye, microplastics have been found to be dispersed in all environmental compartments and have a great ability to enter, influence and endanger natural food webs. The Environmental Investigation Agency estimated that a total of 51 trillion microplastic particles have accumulated in the ocean, with up to 219,000 tonnes of microplastics entering the sea from Europe each year. Microplastic pollution caused by washing processes of synthetic textiles has recently been assessed as the main source of primary microplastics in the oceans. Standard washing machines do not include a microfiber filter and an effective solution to reduce fibre emissions is not available on the market. PlanetCare has developed Fibrestop, the first built-in microfiber filter for washing machines. The device consists of a durable housing, a replaceable cartridge and an internal filter. Filtering is based on physical capture of fibres and no chemicals are used at any stage of the process. The cartridges can be returned to PlanetCare for recycling, ensuring a completely closed loop system and a circular business model. Having a retention rate verified by third parties testing, Fibrestop has to possibility to nullify the microplastic pollution derived from washes, generating tangible benefits for the environment and the people.The EIC funding will enable PlanetCare to optimize the Fibrestop and to perform all the validation activities necessary to obtain CE Mark and start commercialization in Europe.;14.04.21 20:54;231656

It is the world’s first autonomous drone-system designed to remove unwanted material. It consists of two components: - WasteSharks: a (swarm of) drone(s) - SharkPod: a launch/remove/waste unloading docking station/installationOur vision is to put a WasteShark-system in a specific waste-rich area (close to trash chokeholds that are found consistently) where a holistically networked swarm of WasteSharks finds and collects the waste and then delivers its """"catch"""" to the SharkPod. When deployed, the WasteSharks match learned and known conditions and head directly to where the largest concentration of debris is, given the information gathered on prior missions.  The swarm capability will increase efficiency of our drones, by 50% for a small swarm and 120% for the swarm of 10 drones. This allows existing and potential customers to become more efficient in collecting waste, whether plastics and other non-biodegradables (solid waste), oils and chemicals (liquid waste), pest plants (harmful biomass) or a combination of those.Used widely in the markets we will be focusing on, the WasteShark results in a 12 - 32% worldwide decrease of plastic debris (estimated between 4.8 to 12.7 million metric tons) that reaches open waters and causes not recoverable damage to our oceans.""";09.04.21 14:37;231308

We aim to develop a sustainable, transparent, proven solution, promoting a full circular economy based on the upcycling of every AT component. To achieve a complete, cycle of used ATs, Re-Match has developed a ground-breaking patented process combining state-of-the-art technologies, adding the missing link to complete the upcycling of the plastic component. Re-Match is already capable of separating used ATs into sand, rubber and plastic (the first two efficiently recycled). Now, by dissolving the high-quality clean plastic material into a new resin, we will generate new turf yarns of similar quality to the originals, to be applied into new ATs, significantly reducing the waste derived from ATs and decreasing their environmental footprint. The process offers a cradle-to-cradle solution and a fully circular economy model for every AT component. Over 5 years, our resin has the potential to cumulatively save 450,000 tons of CO2e due to recyling of plastic fibres which have traditionally been difficult to be disposed off. As the AT demand and disposal has steadily increased following an annual growth of 16.6% between 2015 and 2017, and the sports segment is the most sought after, Re-Match aims to capture the new trends related to green and sustainable processes. As the team has grown, we have strengthened the process development and initiated the setup manufacturing capabilities, achieving important technological and commercial milestones. This project, aligned with our company strategy, will in a 5-year term allow the expansion of the full business, accumulating profits of €20M and creation of additional 22 FTEs exclusively from the EIC Accelerator project. In the long term, Re-Match will target the delivery of the plastic components also to other applications, establishing a new standard for plastic use and end-purpose.;14.04.21 20:38;231845

Polyps and early-stage CRCs are usually asymptomatic or have symptoms that can be easily confused with other mild ailments. This cancer can be cured in more than 90% of cases if precancerous polyps are detected and removed. Colonoscopy is the most effective method to remove polyps in the entire colon. However, 8% of CRCs are diagnosed after a negative colonoscopy, and 22% of polyps are not detected due to visual limitations of the colonoscope camera. MiWEndo Solutions is a medical device startup focused on bringing innovative technologies to practical diagnosis of diseases related with tumor processes. Its first product is MiWEndo, a low cost and safe electromagnetic device designed to be attached to the tip of a conventional colonoscope. MiWEndo automatizes polyp detection emitting an alarm when a polyp is sensed, increases the field of view to 360º and provides quantitative differentiation between malignant and benign polyps without changing current clinical practice. Its core technology is based on microware imaging, and we have developed algorithms that can differentiate between healthy colon mucosa, cancer, and different histological types of polyps based on their dielectric properties. Our technology is protected with European patent EP3195786A1. After CRC detection, additional applications of our technology will include other bowel disorders. We have a financial need of 3,8 M€ between 2020 and 2023 (product launch). Of these, 1,5 M€ will be provided as a grant from the European Commission within the EIC Accelerator Program (2020-2022), corresponding to 70% of the project budget.

By 2025, the worldwide production of data will grow to 175 zettabytes, which is 10 times the amount of data humanity produced in 2017. The gap is rapidly widening and we will not be able to store more than 20% of produced data by 2025, a scenario which poses a serious risk to our entire digital ecosystems and digital safety. Today, digital data is predominantly stored in large datacentres that are a major contributor of CO2 emissions and a growing environmental concern. This even further promotes the urgent need of our society to shift the paradigm towards more sustainable storage technologies. DATANA is a patented innovation that enables this shift by utilizing DNA as an abundant, sustainable, and stable solution for the storage of data. As such, DNA has a lifespan of 1000+ years and the capacity to hold 20-million times more data per gram of substance than any other existing storage technology. Due to the high costs of DNA synthesis, the utilization of DNA for data storage is today still too expensive and time consuming to be used commercially.  DATANA solves this issue by using a patented data encoding algorithm and a proprietary liquid handling system that reduces the volumes of DNA synthesis to picolitre range (one billionth of a milliliter). By doing so, it enables economically viable DNA storage of data for the first time. This represents a remarkable breakthrough and a major stepping stone for humanity, as it enables us to encode data into DNA at a cost comparable to the storage media used today. The project goal is to further optimize and scale-up our technology, which will allow for the demonstration of its potential at a commercially relevant scale and enable commercialization on the global data storage market by 2023.;14.04.21 18:55;233427

Being entirely passive, no external electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic power will be required to run or control the system. The system will use a heat pipe to transfer the necessary heat to a shaped memory alloy (SMA) component whose movement will, through a set of mechanical linkages, open a flap set within the nacelle inner walls. This system will permit an optimisation of the engine thermal management and performance whilst needing minimal maintenance. Based on an agreed set of requirements, the project partners will first perform a trade-off in terms of possible heat pipe and SMA material and geometric forms, followed by their full characterisation. This information will permit a) the design of the system to be performed after a trade-off considering the constraints (positioning, extreme temperatures and aircraft accelerations) linked to the installation of such a system in a nacelle b) the modelling of the system’s behaviour. Having completed the design, a functional prototype will be tested on a specifically design test bench to simulate operation conditions including pressure, temperature and vibration according to the requirements of the DO160, mandatory for all equipment used on aircraft. The results of the tests performed on the functional prototype will be integrated into the design of a demonstrator (which may also be used for flight tests) which in turn will be manufactured and tested. Modelling activities will support the project throughout its execution.

Defects and contaminants are often detected only after production (end-of-line quality control) using cumbersome, slow and expensive X-Ray machines. This problem has a major impact on manufacturers and consumers as raw materials, production efforts and energy are irreversibly wasted due to this late and partial inspection. Moreover, due to the emergence and increasing prominence of high-performance composites cut across all fields – wind power (e.g. wind turbine blades), aerospace, automotive - effective and reliable production control and inspection techniques still remain incipient – most of the inspection techniques are still done in a visual and manual way (“market creation” opportunity).  Tulipz is a disruptive IoT plug & play solution for inline production and quality control, which combines a patented Terahertz (THz) technology with proprietary deep-learning algorithms deployed as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform. It allows for total real-time, distributed, non-destructive inspection (NDI) along production lines instead of the currently used end-of-line approach, thus guaranteeing quality, increased throughput and minimal waste. The estimated benefits to customers are substantial: a 5x increase in productivity, equipment uptime of 99.99% and a reduction in production waste by 5%. TiHive is a team of energetic, enthusiastic and disruptive entrepreneurs, industrialists and researchers who founded the company after ten years of advanced R&D.

This added resistance has severalconsequences: 1) dramatic speed loss, 2) increase of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, and 3) dangerous roll (side to side) andpitch (up and down) movement that causes seasickness and decreases crew productivity.  Adding wings or foils to a ship bow can use wave energy to propel the ship forward and damp roll and pitch motions, stabilizing the ship. However, navigating with bow foils is counterproductive in certain situations, such as in calm or extreme weather, where the foils increase the ship resistance. A retraction and storage mechanism for the foils in these situations is desired, but until now no practical solution had been developed for bow foils retraction.We, at Wavefoil, have developed the first ever retractable bow foils. Combining the use of strong and flexible composite materials with aninnovative and patent-pending vertical retraction mechanism, we have developed the first and only retractable bow foil modules that fit the narrow bow of any vessel. Our bow foils: 1) reduce the energy consumed to propel the ship by 5-20%, 2) reduce pitch and roll motion, promoting a more comfortable and productive trip, 3) can be retracted/deployed to optimize the ship performance for any given situation. Our unique foil retraction system allows, for the first time ever, to exploit the full range of benefits of bow foils. The SmartWings project aims to mature and bring to market a unique solution for ship stabilization and forward thrust for medium-size ships. The retractable foils will become our gold-standard product and will boost Wavefoil growth, generating €75m profits and 26 new job positions by 2027. In this time, commercialization will save 1,097k tonnes of CO2(eq) emissions and €179m for global shipping.

These temperatures are commonly achieved by using cryogenic liquefied gases (cryogens), such as liquid helium (He). However, there are a numbers of problems related to the use of these cryogens which include the oligopoly of He-3, high costs of cooling machines (€ 300-600k), and safety problems. To solve these pains, kiutra has developed a cryogen-free, continuous, and fully automatic refrigeration system based on a cryogenic magnetic cooling process known as (Continuous) Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigeration - (C)ADR. (C)ADR uses widely available and low-price cooling media, saving € 20-40k/year in comparison with typical refrigeration systems that use He-3. Moreover, the system has a complete modular and customizable design, as it can be extended with multiple units according to the cooling requirements. It also offers a wide and stable temperature range while being easy to operate and hazard-free, thanks to the elimination of cryogens. kiutra, founded in 2018 in Germany, builds easy-access turn-key refrigeration solutions. Their cooling devices combine magnetic refrigeration and closed-cycle pre-cooling to provide cryogenic temperatures without cryogens. kiutra is currently funded by “EXIST Transfer of Research”, and has raised almost € 2M to date.;04.10.21 19:28;230728

It is the fourth chronic condition impacting the most severely patients’ quality of life, ahead of cancer, visual impairments, and chronic respiratory conditions.  Crohn’s disease is an intestinal disorder causing chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It is mainly diagnosed in young people, from 15 to 40 years old. Patients experience excruciating symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, joints pain and swelling. In some cases, it may even be mortal. Besides this tremendous health impacts, the disease is associated with over €30 billion of annual costs. Exeliom Biosciences is an innovative French AME created in 2016 with a mission to bring a new life to Crohn’s Disease patients. The company is developing a game-changing drug, named EXL01, which relies on a unique commensal bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzi. Unlike current Crohn’s Disease treatments, EXL01 achieves long-term remission in mild-to-moderate Crohn’s disease patients without any side effect. It will decrease the number of existing treatments which present a very bad benefit/risk ratio and strong costs in mild-to-moderate patients. Therefore, besides its tremendous health impact, EXL01 will decrease by several million direct and direct costs related to Crohn’s Disease. Exeliom Bioscience has built a team of 5 operational people, and board of 6 scientific and 5 business advisors. The company has also strong collaborations with key international centres and industrials. The company has its own manufacturing process to produce the drug substance and EXL01 has been tested in preclinical studies. Thanks to the EIC Accelerator, Exeliom will reach phase 2a clinical trial and scale-up its manufacturing process. Eventually, EIC Accelerator would place Exeliom on a trajectory to become a global leader in the treatment of Crohn’s Disease.;14.04.21 22:05;230607

First published clinical data show that ADVOS improves survival by up to 30% in critically ill patients on intensive care. The first COVID-19 patient with MOF is being treated with ADVOS in Germany at present with promising results. ADVITOS is a SME instrument Phase 2 beneficiary: ADVOS 880349 for device usability improvement, IoT integration, and market expansion (2.3m€ grant). Following the urgent EU call for corona solutions, we apply now for the blended finance option to speed up device production and installation in Germany and other EU countries. The applied funding and equity is necessary in therapy application, service and sales resources as well as accelerated clinical evidence for medical indication guidance. Integrating fluid-based blood oxygenation for comprehensive lung support and AI/digital capabilities will achieve additional therapy and outcome improvement. Each year, 60% of intensive care patients - 500,000 individuals in Western Europe and the US - die of MOF. The coronavirus outbreak will further increase this number dramatically as COVID-19 often leads to MOF. The innovative ADVOS therapy has the potential to revolutionize intensive care therapy of patients worldwide, as it is the 1st and only blood purification therapy combining liver, lung, kidney support and direct blood pH correction in 1 device (technology leader in removal of liver toxins and fast extracorporeal blood pH correction). It will help to save lives in the current Corona crisis.The ADVOS therapy is low-invasive as standard hemodialysis, so it can support by far more ICU patients than other devices (that have a higher risk profile). This relates especially to the removal of CO2 (by ADVOS) which relieves the lung and reduces the need/invasiveness of ventilation.;14.04.21 22:55;230595

It is not replaceable as a form of drive. Especially for transport vehicles that have to carry heavy weights. As a result of that fact, the combustion of fossil fuels in engines generates 23% of the global CO2.With the EIC project, we want to make the combustion engine environmentally friendly and bring the KEYOU-inside- technology (TRL6) to the market. KEYOU-inside- are components that can be integrated into new or existing combustion engines and enables the engine to run on hydrogen. The product defines a leap in terms of current capabilities and qualities and addresses a gigantic market. Our starting market alone, the bus and truck industry, has a volume of €350 bn. In principle, our customers are all OEMs and end customers in the conversion business. We are open to manufacturers and therefore extremely scalable. In the future, even large generators, ship engines etc. can be made hydrogen capable with our system.Hydrogen combustion engines offer many advantages: the same availability and service life as Euro 6 vehicles, higher customer value than alternative drive concepts (payload, number of passengers, range), low susceptibility to maintenance and the existence of an service infrastructure.Although various manufacturers have recognised the potential of an H2engine, they have never been able to resolve the conflict between zero emissions, efficiency and economy. KEYOU can meet this demand: An emission-free vehicle that, in comparison to the Euro 6 vehicle, can be operated with high performance, customer benefit and at the same time with unchanged total costs.

Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) is a pain relief technique that consist in delivering current pulses to the spinal cord in order to block the sensation of pain. Basic SCS devices comprise implantable leads that are connected to a pulse generator controlled by a control unit. The leads currently available in the market are rather bulky and rigid, poorly stretchable and usually their implantation requires a complex chirurgical intervention.The Percutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation Paddle Lead (SCS ExpertTM) proposed by WISE is a foldable lead fit for minimally invasive percutaneous implantation, which can be achieved by neurosurgeons and anesthetists.

Despite this large need, currently there is no cure available for AD. Moreover, the clinical trial failure rate for novel AD therapies being tested is over 99%. Every failed trial leads to large financial losses for the trial sponsor, and as a result there is an urgent need to reimagine AD clinical trial design. Recently, there has been a paradigm shift in the design of AD clinical trials, with most new trials now focusing on enrollment of Prodromal AD (P-AD) patients. However, patient recruitment in the P-AD stage is challenging as current methodologies (PET, MRI) lead to a large number of false positive and negative cases. As a result, optimal stratification of P-AD patients during clinical trial recruitment, remains an unmet market need. To meet this market need, ADmit Therapeutics, an innovative diagnostics SME, aims to deliver MAP-AD: an automated epigenetic analysis platform for accurate prediction of progression status of P-AD patients. The MAP-AD platform relies on novel machine learning algorithms that can identify specific methylation patterns in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) isolated from the blood samples of P-AD patients. This allows for a rapid and accurate selection of patients to be enrolled into a clinical trial independent of Aβ status, for the first time. During this EIC Accelerator project, we will finalize the development of our predictive algorithms together with a dedicated software interface, and perform clinical validation in collaboration with our hospital partners to deliver a finalized platform that is ready for commercial launch.

With this Themis project, the company introduces “STK Spray”, an on-scene sperm-revealing technology that will disrupt the way crime scene investigation is conducted in case of rape. While forensic lamps fail to detect 90% of sperm traces on a scene, resulting in lengthy and often pointless screening of samples sent to labs, STK Spray sharply reveals the presence of sperm on any floor, object, skin, hair, grass… in one single minute. This is a game-changer for Crime Scene Technicians (CST). A major bottleneck for police investigation and sexual offenders DNA identification is unlocked in a few sprays. This performance is backed by a successful proof of concept done during SME Phase 1 project SexAssault-ID.In this Themis project, AXO Science will scale-up this technology and prepare for a massive commercialisation of the product worldwide.

The Swedish company Hamlet Pharma provides new cancer treatments based on a peptide-based molecular approach for targeting and killing tumour cells with greater precision. Its proprietary drug complex, HAMLET (‘Human Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumour cells’) is derived from the human breast milk protein, alpha-lactalbumin, and represents a ground-breaking therapeutic solution with high tumour-killing capacity, high target specificity, killing >40 different types of tumour cells and no demonstrated toxicity. As such, it has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment. Hamlet Pharma is now advancing HAMLET and the synthetic drug candidate Alpha1H along the clinical development pipeline as anti-cancer therapeutic for early stage bladder cancer. The company is focusing on bladder cancer given the high clinical need for more effective and safe treatment options. Bladder cancer has the highest recurrence rates (70%) and treatment costs per patient among all cancer types (total costs in Europe: >€4.9 billion). Recent successful outcomes include initial Phase I/II clinical trial data, proving that Alpha1H acts with high efficacy without any detectable toxicity. With the EIC Accelerator funding, Hamlet Pharma will finalise Phase I/II clinical safety and efficacy studies and advance development of Alpha1H towards a Phase III trial (i.e. ready for licensing deal or IPO). Conversations with potential licensing partners and investors are ongoing. Alpha1H will be an important showcase of the impact HAMLET will have on cancer treatment (expected cumulative revenues: €350M five years after market approval).

A major aspect for controlling the Coronavirus pandemic is the implementation of tools that allow rapid screening of patients at the healthcare centers and not only. Fast and accurate diagnosis of early infections will facilitate the clinical management of the virus, and will improve patients' prognosis. The diagnostic gold standard for Coronavirus is the RNA detection of pharyngeal swab specimen by RT-PCR. However, the limitations of time, need of devices and specialized personnel to perform RT-PCR, combined with the rapid spread and universal susceptibility to the general population, make this diagnostic technique incompatible with the urgent medical needs. Moreover, the number of RT PCR kits available are limited and the production cannot cope with the high demand. The main objective of this study is to develop a rapid, easy and economical screening test for Coronavirus with the capability to achieve results in less than one hour, with high sensitivity and specificity.

In this process, the bottleneck is the design of the magnetic components that are present in the power converters. The design of the magnetics takes around 6 months on average and the resulting designs are almost never satisfactory. Surprisingly, the same design methods have been used for the last decades. These methods generate delays and excessive costs during the manufacturing process and hold back the advancements in power electronics. SP Control is a company specialized in providing solutions for industrial companies to improve their processes. Our software FRENETIC, based on our proprietary AI technology, has attained great interest in the power converters market due to its capacity to achieve optimal designs for magnetics in just a few hours versus the current 6 months, meaning a design time reduction of nearly 100%. As a result, it allows to reduce the manufacturing costs and size by half. A minimum viable version of FRENETIC is being commercialised in a software design service model entering the power electronics market and bringing great benefits to our clients. Our objective is to disrupt the power electronics market with the first solution that will allow the industrial companies to obtain optimal designs for their magnetics in a matter of hours, reducing their manufacturing costs and their time-to-market. In order to take the fully evolved version of FRENETIC to the market, we need to scaleup our business model and demonstrate its value in a fully operative environment. In a market which value in 2023 has been estimated in €46 billion, the successful market uptake of our innovation represents a breakthrough in industrial design and a great business opportunity as large as €5 billion.;09.04.21 15:20;229863

Gut bacteria imbalance is now recognized as a crucial factor in the development of many diseases – chronic, obesity, diabetes, liver, cardio, cancer and neurodegenerative.  Traditional probiotics used today, aimed at restoring this imbalance, are not effective: They are incapable of delivering sufficient number and variety of bacteria to the correct location in the gut and have them colonize. MyBiotics, a microbiome company, developed a novel technology for very efficient growth, delivery, and colonization of needed bacteria types in the gut. The technology uses innovative fermentation methods to grow complex bacteria communities on micro-particles, dry it to powder and place into capsules administered like any probiotic supplement. MyBiotics proved the technology for single-strain-bacteria and for replicating multi-strain biological samples. In this project it is introducing MBSelect, which will remove the reliance on a biological sample and add formulation of multi-strain communities of human bacteria, grown in pre-selected clusters in any combination. The MBSelect innovation enables, for the first time, the creation of personalized, microbiome-based probiotics, fitted to any purpose – recovery from illness, chronic condition, or as supplements – and fitted to specific microbiome needs of different ethnicities, age, and gender. MyBiotics won and executed a Phase1 feasibility study in 2015, which served as a basis for its development since and for this project application. MyBiotics’ objectives in this project are to complete the development of the MBSelect technology, develop its first three probiotic products, scale them to industrial level, test them, and produce the 1st batch for initial commercial market testing immediately following the project; followed by full EU & US commercialization and scaling.  The success of MBSelect is key in realizing the potential of MyBiotics and enabling the company to grow.";14.04.21 23:06;229624

Its first product is in orthopaedics, but with the Corona Crisis and the cancellation of all elective procedures, the platform has been extended to other pathologies.  On 18/03, a monitoring protocol of suspected Covid19 patients has been offered to General Practitioners (GP), enabling them to follow-up symptoms of hundreds of patients, and intervene in case of need.  The topic of this program remains orthopaedic joint replacements. But the benefits of the solution and its applicability for infectious or disabling diseases which restricts movement to the GP will be clear to the reader.  Joint replacements are referred to as the surgery of the century, as the number are growing exponentially. But 20-30% of patients remain unsatisfied and quality of care is not measured.  moveUP offers patients a safe, efficient and qualitative therapy to be made from the comfort of their home. It uses medical device certified machine learning models to adapt activity level, exercises, medication and coach patients, under uner supervision of healthcare providers.   The therapy has shown in clinical studies to offer excellent outcomes, lower variability, and objective measure of quality, at a lower cost compared to standard of care. More than 1200 patients have been treated and it is the first digital therapy fully reimbursed by the national health insurance in Belgium.   moveUP and has taken first steps to expand across Europe. But the fragmentation of the European Healthcare markets makes it more difficult for a start-up to scale and raise funding.  The purpose of this application is to enable moveUP to adapt and certify its therapy in 4 target countries, run large scale pilots to demonstrate efficacy and health economic benefit, and to conclude partnerships with strategic partners to gain scale.;14.04.21 22:47;230442

Also, sunlight causes LCD screens to consume a lot of power as they have to compete with the sun’s rays for the image to be visible to the human eye.High grid connection and installation costs, which can be as high as 2x the totem cost thus increasing total cost of ownershipTo address this, the SolarDOOH – Imecon (IT), S’Tile (FR), LGOptics (LV) and Agenzia del Trasporto Pubblico Locale del bacino della Città Metropolitana di Milano, Monza e Brianza, Lodi e Pavia (IT) – will commericalize the world’s first off-grid digital signage totem that is unlimited by electricity accessibility and dramatically reduces TOC (22%), O&M costs (33%), installation costs (66%) and installation time (1 day). For power, the totem will use a photovoltaic (PV) system coupled with a battery system and will incorporate an innovative solar backlight technology that uses sunlight as a complementary, rather than competing light, enabling >50% reduction in power consumption. This technology will be integrated in smart bus shelters and provide information stream to its users. Being off-grid enables creation of mobile totems for use during mass gatherings such as concerts, marathons, demonstrations or unexpected events in cities like emergency roadblocks.Through this project, the consortium seeks to optimise the solar backlight system, integrate and test the totem at bus shelters.

The best curative treatment option is liver transplantation. The need for liver transplants for HCC by far exceeds the number of available organs, so stringent selection criteria are of paramount importance in order to ensure that the best candidates are selected for the procedure. So far, clinicians have to rely only on clinical variables to select transplant candidates for liver transplantation. The current criteria used (MILAN and San Francisco criteria) limits transplant to patients within specific parameters as tumour number and diameter, clearly related to disease and tumour biological behavior, but can only act as surrogate markers of tumour stage and biology. Hence, it is not possible to predict which patients outside the Milan or San Francisco criteria that would have a favourable prognosis. On this background, it is of outmost importance to gain access to better predictive tools that can provide decision support in selection for these patients. In response to this challenge, Ophiomics has developed a powerful predictive tool (HepatoPredict) based on molecular signature and clinical parameters, rather than only clinical variables. We can predict the good outcome of the intervention with a successful-curative rate of 95%, improving the Milan and San Francisco criteria (67%). Unsuccessful liver transplantation will be avoided and, as a consequence, better survival rate and more saved lives will be achieved. Upon 5 years after the completion of the project, HepatoPredict will boost the growth of our company generating additional 27 employees and a ROI of 13.82. With the help of SME instrument, Ophiomics aims to complete the clinical validation and product optimization so that it can be commercialized across European markets first, and global markets later on, improving the quality of care of healthcare systems worldwide as well as the HCC patient ́s quality of life.;15.04.21 04:26;229091

As venotomies get bigger it becomes more difficult to close them, leading to complications (blood loss, haematoma, infection and thrombosis). Developments in transcatheter heart valve procedures and left atrial appendage occlusion requires large venotomies in the femoral vein to gain access to the heart. These large venotomies are difficult to close, leaving patients exposed to additional complications, pain and discomfort. Hence, there is a strong unmet medical need for effective methods to close venotomies.Vivasure Medical Limited is a Irish R&D performing medical device company, established in 2008 and secured a total of €45M funds. Vivasure developed the patented PerQseal platform technology as effective method for large arterial and venous closures. PerQseal Venous is the world’s first absorbable patch-based closure product for large venotomy closure (over 8 mm). By delivering an intra-venous patch without surgery, a surgeon can seal vessels from inside while providing a matrix to support wound healing. PerQseal Venous is largely based on Vivasure’s already existing and well-validated PerQseal®Arterial product, used to close arterial vessels and already in clinical use.Following clinical validation and preparation for EU and US wide commercialisation in the VENOCLOSE project, Vivasure will target the large and ever-growing venous closure market. Vivasure has successfully obtained ISO13485 Certification and CE certification for its arterial closure device, which will pave the way for PerQseal Venous. The company will leverage existing customer-base among cardiologists and distribution partner, contributing to a further de-risking of PerQseal Venous commercialisation.

Globally, construction and the use of building materials account for 50% of extracted materials, 50% of its energy consumption, 33% of its water consumption and 33% of all waste generation. The construction material manufacturing process incinerates virgin materials, changing their natural properties and rendering them non-biodegradable and eventually problematic waste. This resource-intensive process is a massive CO2 emitter, and revolutionizing it is a key EC priority. The circular economy represents a €4 trillion opportunity however, with a global economy that is only 9.1% circular, there is a massive circularity gap.  Redesigning the entire lifecycle of building products and their production methods is central to reducing the environmental impact of the construction industry and developing a circular economy. Criaterra’s disruptive innovation produces products using minimal energy (90% energy savings compared to ceramics), generate minimal emissions (97% GHG savings compared to concrete), are manufactured from up to 70% recycled materials and are 100% recyclable and 100% biodegradable. They have the strength of concrete and very low thermal conductivity. They dramatically reduce the energy consumption, waste stream and CO2 emissions of the built environment.

OrbitalAds is a Spanish start up founded with mission of helping our clients make the most of their online advertising investment, create perfect ads and keep on improving their conversion results automatically saving time, money and effort. WHAT IS OA PROJECT ABOUT?SEM is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engines through paid advertising and keywords are the most fundamental and significant element of SEM.Selection of the right keywords is one of the most challenging topics when running an effective marketing campaign. However, the selection and generation of the perfect keywords is a huge challenge. Just think that in Google, up to five billion searches are made every day in more than one hundred languages, so imagine the incalculable number of possible keyword combinations.Evidently, a truly efficient management of keywords can never be performed manually, but surprisingly, keywords management is the only process that after almost 20 years is still performed manually in SEM strategies.We have been the first and only ones to develop a solution for automatization of the keywords management process using Language Agnostic Smart Semantic Targeting based on Natural Language processing and Machine Learning. OA technology is capable of “understanding” words in hundreds of languages and phrases combining different words within a semantic context, to fully automate the keywords section process in SEM campaigns.OA has the true potential to become the global referent player in automatization of digital Advertising, which is a multibillion market that represents for us a €7 Billion market opportunity. The Series A round we are seeking now, would allow us embracing this business opportunity. We are requesting €3M (50% Grant + 50% equity) to the EC, to help us achieving our goals and bring EU at the forefront of the digital advertising market.;15.04.21 03:36;228339

However, their use should be minimized as much as possible due to ethical issues and since only 9.6% of drugs entering phase I of clinical trials end up being commercialized.  Therefore, the goal of this action is to develop a novel proprietary 3D in vitro cardiac assay.  The SmartHeart will retrieve several of the most important read-outs commonly assessed to study the impact of drugs at the cardiac level in the pre-clinical phase. The all in one assay will be based on a microstructured gel where cardiac cells, as cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells will be cultured. The SmartHeart will answer to the shortcomings of academic and commercial available in vitro assays, by enabling the qualitative and quantitative measurement of several parameters, as contractility and Calcium transients. Simultaneously, the assay will enable sub-cellular structure observation via high-resolution imaging techniques. Furthermore, the 3D nature of the assay will contribute to the efficient maturation of the induced CMs, which is still a limiting factor when not using cardiac human cells, but rather induced CMs, in in vitro assays. The ultimate aim of the project is to make this device available to screening platforms, e.g. Pharma or CROs. The technology will be implemented in multiwell plates compatible with the standards of HTS/HCS and will be available to early-users, from whom feedback will be acquired, enabling to fine tune the specifications of the final device. This project will meet the best of the ER competences in physics, with the expertise of 4Dcell in 3Dcell culture systems. With this project, the ER will reach a level of maturity on several technological, managerial and industrial aspects providing her a new career angle and put her a step closer to act as a leader in research.;07.08.20 14:17;227668

Laboratory test cases have shown that this technology is capable of controlling many aspects of premixed and non-premixed combustion in small burners as well as in industrial-scale systems. However, the fundamental aspects of this interaction between a reacting flow and an electric field remain mostly unknown and this prevents the application of this technology in industrial applications. The complexity of the required models and the large computational cost associated with the simulation of the electric response of a flame to an electric field have so far limited the numerical analysis of this type fo flows to one-dimensional and two-dimensional configurations taking into account only laminar flames. Considering that most of the industrial burners are operated in the turbulent regime, it appears necessary to shed light on the behavior of electrified flames at high Reynolds number.

Their impressive fossil record traces their evolution from their terrestrial ancestors (Artiodactyla), to the present aquatic forms. All living cetaceans have flippers instead of limbs, possess a blowhole at the top of the head instead of an anteriorly-positioned nose. They have also developed a characteristic head shape connected to their feeding mode: while baleen whales have lost their teeth and feed using keratinous plates called baleen, toothed whales have evolved the ability to locate their prey using sound waves (echolocation). Changes in prenatal development (ontogeny) played a major role in allowing these animals to evolve the skull adaptions they currently display related to their peculiar traits. Though, little information is available on their development, limiting our understanding of the role of ontogeny in the evolution of modern cetaceans.This project aims to apply 3-dimensional (3D) imaging and cutting-edge geometric morphometric (GM) and phylogenetic methods to quantify the ontogeny of the skull in a diverse sample of cetaceans and terrestrial artiodactyls in order to reconstruct how development has shaped the evolution and diversification of this unique group of mammals.

The process is biologically safe, uses zero toxic chemicals, reduces water consumption by 90% and cuts energy use by at least 20%.Colorifix' target markets are very large and include sustainable high street fashion, luxury apparel, sportswear, and automotive textiles, amounting to global trade of €370 billion p.a. The provision of textile dyeing services in these markets is worth c. €10 billion p.a, and growing at a rate of c. 9% p.a.The technology is highly scalable and low-cost compared to rival methods. This is because it avoids the cost of extracting and purifying pigments, and because the process is compatible with standard dye machines. The company will transform textile dyeing from one of the most environmentally harmful industries to an eco-friendly, sustainable process.Commercial interest in Colorifix is extremely high. The company is already engaged in lab-scale trials with the largest global fashion brands and textile producers, including Stella McCartney, Filippa K, a global fibre producer and one of the world's largest automotive textiles producers. The Phase 2 project will provide the capital needed to construct and operate a pilot production facility, enabling testing for customers on pre-production volumes, and preparing full commercial scale-up of the technology in textile production around the world.;03.03.20 13:30;227468

The bleeding edge are now quantum processors having about 50 quantum bits, and the challenge is to pass the 1,000 quantum bit milestone. But this also means a huge amount of communication-channels between those quantum processors in a cryogenic fridge with external control electronics outside these fridges. At present, existing (coax) cabling technologies are inadequate for connecting quantum processors of that size with the outside world. This poses a critical bottleneck for developing large scale quantum computers, and without solving that problem, the quantum revolution will come to a halt.Delft Circuits is the first company that has developed ultra-thin cabling solutions for the emergent quantum industry. These are high-tech, flexible cables, fully dedicated to microwave frequencies in cryogenic environments. We are selling pre-cursor cabling products to various organisations worldwide since Q1 2019. Our Cri/oFlex® technology allows our customers to build quantum computers requiring many communication channels, since our present technology is already capable of shrinking the footprint significantly. Such reduction in footprint is an essential requirement for paving the way to large scale quantum computing. We will develop in this project a solution for integrating microwave and thermal components in a monolithic cabling solution. This is an essential step to further increase the scale of quantum computers towards 1,000 or more quantum bits. We have setup a network of validation and qualification partners, including Massachusetts Institute of Technologies and Google, which collaborate in the project. Thereby, this project enables us to accelerate our product development to TRL8 significantly, to strengthen the European eco-system of SMEs in quantum industry, and to become an important player in the emergent value chain.;15.04.21 01:06;227205

This question will open brand new relations between algebraic and topological invariants of these singularities. The main tool to approach the problem will be to develop representations of vertex algebras on the cohomologies or derived categories of these moduli spaces conjecturally giving rise to analogues of the Nekrasov parition function on the singularities. Then we will use recent new developements about a specific motivic measure with values in the Grothendieck ring of geometric dg categories to prove some simplification of the aimed correspondence. In the end we will raise these simplified results to the general level.This project will allow the researcher to broaden his area of expertise as well as to develop new directions in his research lines.

The key development and innovation points are:  Autonomous working mode, potentially in the absence of the operator, along with the autonomous management of the failures (smart assistance for error management); should a failure be detected, the system will propose the possible causes, also generating a non-compliance form, without the intervention of one operator.   Shrink the time needed to produce a complete ATP (Acceptance Test Procedure), along with the necessary reporting.  Distributed architecture: the complexity and wired links length is significantly reduced by adopting a multi-function main unit, wireless connected with interchangeable peripherals and thus simply placing a single (small) unit near the device to be monitored.  High modularity, achieved by: 1) a variable number of boards that can be plugged on the bus; 2) different peripheral modules that can be included in the architecture.  Completeness: the test bench will perform a complete sequence of tests, providing the stimulation signal and verifying the correctness of the results.  Logging: the results achieved by each individual test will be recorded, ensuring the future traceability (logging mode active for both the main unit and peripherals).  The architecture of the system will consist of:  1) a rugged PC, working as a global controller, connected with the company server.  2) a series of peripheral units, connected with the measurement points and wirelessly linked to the controller.";25.03.20 12:42;228081

We have completed over 40 successful projects in Europe and America, totaling over 500MW. The market for solar trackers is growing at a CAGR of 18.6% and will reach €25 billion by 2024. Solar trackers improve energy output by 25% over fixed structures. However, these structures also increase installation and maintenance costs, as well as structural risks. Wind damage is the main source of structural risk for trackers. It significantly shortens the lifespan of tracker arrays. Since PV plants need to resist over 20 years of service to be viable, the risk of systemic failures represents a considerable barrier for the growth of the tracker industry.Over the last years, we have been developing a line of solar trackers, with great commercial success. We have introduced advanced features, positioning ourselves as a technological reference. These features include self-powered motors, a computerized backtracking system, an innovative installation procedure and a bifacial system to catch both direct and reflected sunlight, thus improving efficiency by 5%. We will now upgrade our latest prototype with a unique system, called SecureTracker, that will stabilize trackers to avoid wind-induced structural damage. SecureTracker will provide an outstanding solution against structural risks in large scale arrays, extending average lifetime in 10 years. It will reduce overall Levelized Cost of Energy by 30% for utility-scale solar arrays. At a lower cost than alternatives, SecureTracker will give us a decisive competitive advantage, allowing us to increase yearly installations by 300% by 2026, resulting in over €25 million of additional revenues and a ROI of 8.52. SecureTracker will also increase our visibility in the market and consolidate our brand, leading to the creation of over 50 highly qualified jobs.;03.06.21 15:16;226912

Heegaard Floer homology is a package of powerful invariants for 3-manifolds, and knots and links inside them. Introduced two decades ago, it is now a major research area in low-dimensional topology. To a knot or link in the 3-sphere, together with extra data called `decoration', Heegaard Floer homology associates a bigraded vector space which determines key topological properties of such a knot or link, such as its Alexander polynomial and its Seifert genus. Moreover, given a (decorated) link cobordism between two links, there is a linear map induced between their Heegaard Floer homology. The original definition of Heegaard Floer homology is based on counting pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds, but there exist combinatorial reformulations of the vector spaces associated to decorated knots and links.The proposal consists of three major projects:1) Give a combinatorial reformulation of the Heegaard Floer cobordism maps, to make their computation algorithmic, by extending existing combinatorial definitions of the vector spaces associated to decorated knots and links.2) Extend the most efficient combinatorial reformulation, namely the Kauffman-states functor, from decorated knots to decorated links.3) Define a combinatorial Heegaard Floer invariant for partially decorated links, for which attempts to give an analytic definition seems unfeasible.;20.04.21 00:37;228036

The detoxification organs are nearly always involved in MOF. Therefore, to treat MOF successfully, the vicious cycle of progressing organ failures and increasing toxin accumulation in the body has to be stopped. ADVOS has the potential to revolutionize the therapy of ICU patients worldwide, as it is the first and only ICU device for combined liver, lung, kidney and acid-base support in one device. ADVOS improves survival of patients with MOF from 10 to 50%. No serious side-effects have occurred so far in more than 500 treated patients. Currently, there is no other device in the market that supports all main detoxification organs as the ADVOS system does. As the ADVOS therapy is low-invasive, it can be used by far more intensive care units and can support by far more patients than other devices for e.g. removal of CO2.Although the ADVOS device has the CE mark and is already in the German market (20 first beta user hospitals) the TRL is 6, as we learned in the German market that due to the staff problem and the stressful environment in the ICU the ADVOS usability is by far not good enough to increase revenues more quickly. Therefore, the goal of the SME project ADVOS is faster market entry and penetration through improvement of device usability and ease of use (Integration of accessory components, state of the art turnable touch screen and smart user assistance), integration of IoT for remote access/maintenance in device, and increased marketing and communication measures (Total project cost: 3.3m€ / SME grant amount: 2.3m€).;03.06.21 15:16;226898

HLS allows designers to work at a higher-level of abstraction by using a software program to specify the hardware functionality. Additionally, HLS is particularly interesting for designing field-programmable gate array circuits (FPGA), where hardware implementations can be easily refined and replaced in the target device. Recent years have seen much activity in the HLS research community, with a plethora of HLS tool offerings, from both industry and academia, but none of these solutions are widespread for industrial use.FPGA Programming requires certain skills, specific knowledge and specialised hardware. Gathering these are expensive and due to this limitation can only be achieved by a small fraction of software developers, which makes access to FPGA equally limited. With our solution we aim to give access to those software engineers who lack this specific knowledge.Hastlayer a provides an HLS service consisting of multiple tools that allows desktop, web and mobile software developers to increase the performance of their computationally intensive and resource demanding applications by executing critical parts of their software on a specialised hardware architecture remotely or locally (FPGA) without having the in-depth knowledge of such platforms. This solution results in lower development cost when it comes to optimisation, cheaper hardware when it comes to speeding up a slow program but most importantly makes continuous development exceptionally fast. Before we can turn Hastlayer into a product we need to carry out a feasibility study in order to define use cases tackle security issues and develop the most suitable business mode to maximize market penetration.;15.09.20 18:35;226382

Theexposure of huge amounts of personal information and identities continues to be a major problem without a solution in sight(see sample on the left of recent breaches to tech giants). At the nexus of the world of cyber security and cyber-crime is theparamount issue of password and encryption key storage – the security measures in place to prevent hacking, and thecapabilities of the illegal hackers to hack into storage sites and decipher encrypted messages.Authentico has inventedCIPHRA which is a hardware dependent cryptographic processor that ensures that passwords and encryption keys areessentially impossible to steal even if a database is hacked into. CIPHRA protects the cryptographic infrastructure bysecurely processing passwords, and generating unclonable encryption keys from authentication requests using a technologycalled PUF (physically unclonable functions). Authentico´s solution stands to be a major alternative to traditional key storagemethods. The keys are always present in the device, by generating the key on request. Information, such as passwordhashes, can be inputted, but never read out or extracted. Even weak passwords cannot be broken because the generatedoutputs are useless for an attacker and the database of encrypted and hashed passwords is useless without the key. This isa far better solution than current approaches because the company’s secret keys are never stored anywhere, at any time,making it extremely difficult for any malicious insider or outside hacker to ever gain access to them.;19.12.20 15:25;226625

Tremendous investments in innovation brought traffic avoidance systems, flight data recorders, aircraft tracking... cutting edge tech that unfortunately cannot be transferred to light aviation straight away, just because of one single reason: high costs.Aeroclubs and flying schools are usually low margin businesses, not to mention leisure flying... Commercial aviation equipment costs are too high and regulators, aware of that, cannot impose them as mandatory. However, they are calling for tailored solutions to save lives while maintaining light aviation financially viable.Imagine a cost effective solution for light aircraft operators and regulators to enhance safety and reduce operational costs just by monitoring and analyzing metrics on every flight. Imagine a software, running in the smartphone of the pilot that could make many of the commercial aviation safety features, available to light airplane pilots. Imagine a social approach to it, a network where pilots can share flights, challenge themselves to fly safer and grow as a community. Imagine this is called AVIAZE.Inspired in the successful app Strava for runners, AVIAZE is the social network for pilots that makes flying safer and cheaper. With an addressable market of 5,5 Million pilots. We have registered +2500 flight hours and +1500 pilots so far, it is fully compliant with EU regulations. We’ve started to internationalize and it is supported by EASA and IAA (authorities).The forecasted ROI is 4,0 after Y5 and we estimate a 2 year pay-back period for the total 1.5M€ investment with the creation of a minimum of 7 additional jobs;14.10.20 04:34;226618

Aerosols have multiple unnecessary components, each of which must be sourced from separate suppliers and use significant aluminium (1.58 kg/1,000 units). Multiple components means that specialized equipment is needed to assemble aerosols and slows down filling times. It also makes final products difficult to recycle with 704 million aerosols sent to landfills every year. Purple Holding has developed a completely new aerosol container, Click/Spray, that will shake up this stagnant market for the first time in over 50 years. Our radical new design doesn’t change standard components of conventional aerosols, but completely rethinks their structure to remove the need for a valve mounting cup. Our new, patented valve creates for the first time an opportunity to design endless options for new sizes and shapes. Fewer components means our products are 20% faster to manufacture and assemble, 25% faster to fill, use 5% aluminium and are easier to recycle. This saves the manufacturer €30/1,000 units and 1.5 kg of aluminium for 1,000 units for a reduced environmental impact. This gives aerosol manufacturers and the brand owners who use these products, incredible cost margins and up to 20% more revenue as well as greater control over supply.;07.08.20 14:20;226609

At the same time, the current generation of energy management software is far from enabling efficient energy management at complex industrial sites. The available applications are not able to capture the full process chain, including energy conversions and locally produced commodities which are very typical in the industry. The challenge lies not only in applying analytics to enormous amounts of energy data, but also in linking this data with external information – industrial processes and production data, regulatory info and market data.We tackle these challenges by implementing novel modelling techniques. The Energy Hub is the first energy management platform that makes complex industrial processes fully energy transparent and complies with all upcoming regulation. The Energy Hub unlocks to an unprecedented extent insight into efficiency, deviations and cost allocation, down to product level and in real time, that none of the other tools is currently able to compete with. It leads to savings in energy consumption from 5% to 15%, helping industrial companies to reduce CO2 competitively. By boosting efficiency, the Energy Hub contributes to achieving climate goals and sustainable economic growth.Our value proposition has been validated by numerous industrial giants including our early adopters Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. The 500 largest targeted customers in the EU alone represent 3,500 industrial sites with a €300 million recurring revenue potential to us per annum. Our target for 2025 is to have at least 500 industrial sites connected to the Energy Hub thus saving 1% CO2 emissions in the EU.This feasibility study is aimed at validating technical and economic feasibility of the Energy Hub before moving forward with end-stage development within the framework of the EIC Accelerator programme.;27.08.20 18:49;226597

Mobile hydraulic original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) need solutions to ensure their mobile equipment comply with the stricter EU stage V emission mandate, effective from 2019. Emission reduction systems may be needed which, however, will increase the overall weight of the hydraulic vehicle, resulting in higher fuel consumption. We, at Hansa TMP, with global presence in 64 countries and manufacturers of electro-hydraulic components and systems for mobile and industrial machinery, realised axial piston hydraulic technology as vital for green, efficient mobile equipment and a key development relevant for advancing the emerging electric hydraulic mobile equipment industry. The limitations of current axial piston pumps are higher energy consumption, lack of hydraulics-electronics interconnectivity and low life span. In response, we have developed TPV2500, a compact axial hydraulic piston pump which offers 10% higher energy efficiency, better reliability, efficient automotive control, 100 bars higher working pressure and 5% reduction in maintenance time. The growing agriculture and construction sectors, which account for 75% of all the mobile off-highway market segment sales, are contributing substantially to the axial piston hydraulic pumps market, projected to grow to €1.90Bn in 2025 at a 4.3% CAGR. In Phase 1, we plan to carry out technical and commercial validation and consolidate our commercialisation strategy. These activities will supplement €0.5M worth of work already invested in the project. We expect +€16.4M revenues after 5 years of exploitation of the technology.

GET LOCAL AG is a young and dynamic company from Zurich, Switzerland created with the aim of deploying a digital, B2B booking platform, GET LOCAL, enabling hotels and tourist service providers to combine forces and offer added value to their international guests in the form of exclusive local deals and packages. GET LOCAL operates via local branches, which are joint ventures between GET LOCAL AG and a local service provider and/or Destination Management Organisation to enable swift mobilization of local resources. It employs an in-house-developed software platform which allows high scalability and a competitive advantage to alternative solutions. It also applies Artificial Intelligence to generate personalised suggestions for tourists based on their previous experiences and demographics. We have already launched a prototype in Zurich, Basel and Vienna, with main hotel brands and numerous local service providers already on-board.

Unfortunately, the danger faced during underwater works and the fact that it is an uncontrolled environment for humans, make these activities tremendously expensive and insecure. In fact, most underwater operations require to have an overview of the submerged area before even being performed, for both safety and efficiency in operations. The traditional solution to the underwater inspection challenge consists in gathering images with a video camera, normally embedded in an underwater robot. However, very frequently, these activities take place in environments with poor water visibility conditions, deeming the maps unusable and the whole approach a waste of resources. A new generation of imaging sonars, namely the two-dimensional Forward-Looking Sonars (FLS), have produced a recent breakthrough in the market. These devices, also termed acoustic cameras, are able to directly deliver 2D images of unprecedented clarity and resolution compared to other available sonar technologies. However, working with sonar data is much more challenging than processing optical images. Given the lack of solutions in the market to generate maps with this kind of data, a PhD thesis from the University of Girona (UdG) developed a mosaicing pipeline tailored to the peculiarities of FLS images, providing a pioneering way to map underwater environments in low visibility conditions. IQUA Robotics exclusively licensed the technology from the UdG on January 2019 with the aim of evolving it from TRL5 to TRL 9 and make it commercial by 2020.

However, as the port traffic increases, the interaction between ships and port infrastructure (navigation channels, manoeuvring areas, docks, rivers, locks, etc.) gets more complicated, resulting in system saturation, and hence a greater likelihood of marine accidents occurring. There are very powerful meteorological forecast tools, which provide very valuable information for marine traffic management but they are incomplete and have not even been applied in the clear majority of ports. In this context, Siport21 has developed SafePort, a technology for providing port managers with the most complete and reliable decision tools to manage the operations of the vessels. This technology collects real-time information about the ship approaching the port, as well as meteorological and maritime data, determines whether the operation is viable or not and the requirements to perform the operation in the safest manner. The global marine port and service is a huge market (€ 68.5 bn in 2018) that keeps on growing at a frantic pace, hoping to reach € 78.4 bn by 2023 and hence growing at a Projected CAGR of 4.2%. In this context, SafePort will play an essential role based on its potential to manage nautical operations. We will target the port authorities and terminal operators of the maritime sector.  Following our business strategy, SafePort will be sell as a core product considering considered a selling price of 50,000 euros per port. We will also offer specific consulting (upfront revenue) and software updates (annual fee) services, whose prices will be based on the port complexity. Based on this price policy, our nautical operations management technology will provide a revenue of € 15.6 M by the third year, meaning a cumulative cash flow of € 9.9M. Considering a total investment of € 2.2M, we expect to get a ROI of 350% in 3 years.;15.09.20 18:35;226385

This is highly dependent on the fabrication of embedded Integrated Circuits on semiconductor wafers & the advanced semiconductor packaging processes that protect ICs while providing connectivity to printed circuit boards & adjacent ICs. The fabrication of redistribution layers (RDL), is particularly challenging and expensive, representing a major challenge in the industry. Current RDL microfabrication technology constitutes multi-process chain (19 steps) and is incredibly capital intensive. Existing technology impacts the environment through vast consumption of energy and water. It provides limited flexibility at the wafer-level, restricting the use of optimised materials to microfabricate and limiting manufacturers ability to produce different packaging designs between production cycle, incurring high-fixed costs or expensive downtimes. NanoDrip is the first printing technology which is applicable to advanced packaging, providing ultra-high-resolution microfabrication suitable for industrial manufacturing in merely 2 step-process. It enables digitality, the capability to produced different designs between production cycles with unprecedented flexibility. It introduces a disruptive paradigm shift in the fabrication of advanced electronics at a crucial time for the European industry, allowing European SMEs & large semiconductor manufacturers to gain competitive advantage as demand grows for next-generation of devices. During the phase 1 project, Scrona will establish a go-to-market strategy and a supply chain and will draft further development plan. During the innovation project, Scrona will optimise their proprietary printheads and printing process, optimize in-house printhead manufacturing process, and carry out large-scale demonstration of microfabrication with relevant stakeholders.;20.06.20 15:06;226599

This vast amount of data is stored on hard drives, flash drives and, for long-term archival storage, on magnetic tape. Even magnetic tape, the most durable of storage media, can preserve data no more than 30 years. What is more, the data archived on magnetic tape requires controlled climate (humidity and temperature), electrical energy, and a lot of physical space (huge data centres) to preserve the data, not to mention the necessary non-sustainable raw materials to produce the tape. BioSistemika has developed an innovative, high-tech solution to address these problems by storing digital data into the DNA molecule – the oldest, most efficient data storage medium in history. As a storage medium, DNA is incomparably more efficient than any of humanity’s artificial data storage media in nearly all aspects, capable of storing more than 450 petabytes (450 x 103 terabytes) in a single gram of substance, compared to 0,15 terabytes in a gram of the state-of-the-art LTO-8 magnetic tape by IBM (3 million-fold difference). This means that whole data centres could both be scaled down to the content of a single vial of liquid and be duplicated in a matter of hours with minimal to no costs. Furthermore, DNA was optimized to remain durable and intact within extremely variable environments by the forces of nature. It does not require electricity to preserve data and is resistant to most electromagnetic radiation and most other forms of degradation (e.g. temperature), thus making it the perfect medium to store and archive data. Our business model canvas, which sums up our project, is attached with this application.;17.11.20 17:43;226403

This has given rise the emergenceof an infrastructure investment gap with implications for the EU's economic recovery and competitiveness that aresignificant. The European Investment Bank estimates Europe’s hard infrastructure investment gap for energy, transport,water and sanitation, and telecom sectors at €688 billion per year.Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technology is an integral to European infrastructure development. GPR is a non-invasivegeophysical method that uses radar pulses to image and study the sub-surface picture of what is below the surface of theground for infrastructure applications across multiple industries. However, state-of-the-art (SoA) GPR technologies sufferfrom a significant problem of lack or insufficient data regarding the sub-surface material composition and sub-surface layersand bodies. GPR technology is also expensive and difficult to use.SGPR.TECH proposes a next-generation surface radar, which will become the basis of many solutions dedicated to variousindustries. Unlike the current impulse GPR radar, the SGPR.TECH team wants to use FMCW (Frequency-ModulatedContinuous Wave) radar with a broadband antenna that will conduct the analysis in the field of frequency, not time, allowingus to obtain imaging with the possibility of distinguishing materials, thanks to their different properties of electricalpermeability in the frequency function.;19.12.20 15:25;226622
